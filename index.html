Within the boundaries of Hamilton lie several significant historic Maori sites.
    These sites range in type from Pa, Urupa, and Papakainga.
    The majority of these sites were constructed by the people of Ngati Wairere or its sub-tribes.  Many of the sites are in close proximity to the Waikato river and Hamilton CBD, and are either designated as parks or reserves.  Some sites are currently occupied by buildings.  <a href="Pukete Pa.html">Pukete Pa</a> is one example of a fortified Pa located at Braithwaite park, on the west bank of the waikato river at Pukete Road.  Another Major Pa site located within the Hamilton CBD on London street is <a href="Kirikiriroa Pa.html">Kirikiriroa Pa</a>.
