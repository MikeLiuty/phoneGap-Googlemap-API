<h2>Pa</h2>
<p>
    A pa is a fortified village where Maori Chiefs and Warriors lived.  It was a place of refuge when invading war parties came.  In general fortified Pa was constructed by levelling an area of ground. Holes were dug around the perimeter of the site and large, heavy, adzed wooden poles or split logs would be set close together with manuka stakes leaving a sufficient gap to allow spears to be thrust between them.

<h2>Urupa</h2>
<p>
    Urupa are burial grounds where bodies of tribe members were buried with elaborate ceremonies and rituals. Often the bodies were buried with items of personal adornment or greenstone artefacts.
</p>

<h2>Papakainga</h2>
<p>
A Papakainga was an unfortified and undefended village or hamlet. In pre-European times Papakainga were associated with food production and storage and inhabited by the people involved in these processes.
